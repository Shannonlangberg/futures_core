## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Anthropic API key
- Google Sheets API credentials

### 1. Environment Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd church-voice-assistant

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. API Keys & Credentials

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
# Backend/.env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_FILE=credentials.json
```

### 3. Google Sheets Setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable Google Sheets API and Google Drive API

2. **Create Service Account**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "Service Account"
   - Download the JSON key file
   - Rename it to `credentials.json` and place it in the `backend` directory

3. **Set up Google Sheet**:
   - Create a new Google Sheet named "Stats"
   - Share it with the service account email (found in credentials.json)
   - The sheet should have these columns:
     - Timestamp
     - Campus
     - Total Attendance
     - New People
     - New Christians
     - Youth Attendance
     - Kids Total
     - Connect Groups
     - Tithe Amount
     - Volunteers
     - Encouragement

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
python app.py

# The application will be available at:
# Frontend: http://localhost:5001
# API: http://localhost:5001/api/
```

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Voice Input Examples

**Basic Attendance Logging:**
```
"Hey, we had 150 people today at the main campus, 25 new visitors, and 3 salvations."
```

**Detailed Service Report:**
```
"North campus this morning: 200 total attendance, 15 new people, 5 salvations, 45 youth, 60 kids, 12 connect groups, and we had $15,000 in tithe."
```

**Auto-detected Campus:**
```
"South campus had 180 people, 20 new visitors, and 4 baptisms today."
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - System health check
- `GET /api/stats` - Retrieve recent statistics
- `POST /api/process_voice` - Process voice input
- `GET /api/memory/<campus>` - Get conversation history
- `GET /api/campuses` - List available campuses

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom Campus Detection

Edit the `campus_patterns` in `backend/app.py`:

```python
campus_patterns = {
    "main": r"(?:main\s+campus|downtown|central)",
    "north": r"(?:north\s+campus|northside)",
    # Add your custom campuses here
}
```

### Enhanced Stat Patterns

Add custom stat recognition patterns:

```python
patterns = {
    "total_attendance": r"(\d+)\s+(?:people|attendance|total|adults?)",
    # Add your custom patterns here
}
```

- Try refreshing the page

**Google Sheets Connection Error:**
- Verify `credentials.json` is in the backend directory
- Check that the service account has access to the sheet
- Ensure the sheet name is exactly "Stats"

**Claude API Errors:**
- Verify your Anthropic API key is correct
- Check your API usage limits
- Ensure the API key has proper permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the log level in `backend/app.py`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
