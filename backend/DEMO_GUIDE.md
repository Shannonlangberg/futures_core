# Futures Link Assistant - Demo Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```
You should see:
- "Google Sheets initialized successfully" (or warning if no credentials)
- "Claude initialized successfully"
- "ElevenLabs API key found" (or warning if no key)
- "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5001"

### 2. Test Everything Works
```bash
python demo_test.py
```
This will test all endpoints and show you what's working.

### 3. Open the Frontend
Go to: http://localhost:5001

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Flow

### Opening Demo
1. **Click the orb** - Should hear "Connected to Futures Link, how can I help you today?"
2. **Select a campus** from the dropdown (e.g., "South")
3. **Start talking** - "South campus had 150 people, 8 new visitors, 3 salvations"

### Key Features to Demo

#### 1. Voice Input & Stat Extraction
- Say: "South campus had 150 people, 8 new visitors, 3 salvations"
- Should extract: Attendance: 150, New People: 8, New Christians: 3
- Should respond with AI insights

#### 2. Campus Detection
- Say: "North campus had 200 people"
- Should automatically detect "North" campus
- Should update the dropdown

#### 3. Query System
- Go to: http://localhost:5001/query
- Ask: "How many new people has south campus had this year?"
- Should show historical data and analysis

#### 4. ElevenLabs Voice
- All responses should use ElevenLabs voice (if API key is set)
- Falls back to browser TTS if no ElevenLabs

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### No Voice on Startup
- Check if `/api/greeting_audio` returns 200 OK
- Check ElevenLabs API key in .env file

### Stats Not Extracting
- Check the regex patterns in `extract_stats_with_context()`
- Make sure you say the numbers clearly

### Campus Not Detecting
- Check the campus detection patterns
- Try saying the campus name more clearly

### Backend Won't Start
- Check all required packages are installed
- Check .env file has required API keys
- Check no other process is using port 5001

## ðŸ“Š Demo Data

The system will:
- Store conversation memory in `data/conversation_memory.json`
- Log stats to Google Sheets (if configured)
- Generate audio files in `temp_audio/`

## ðŸŽ‰ Demo Success Indicators

âœ… Greeting voice plays on first orb click  
âœ… Campus detection works automatically  
âœ… Stats extract correctly from voice  
âœ… AI responds with insights  
âœ… Query system shows historical data  
âœ… ElevenLabs voice sounds natural  

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues

1. **No greeting voice**: Check ElevenLabs API key
2. **Stats wrong**: Check regex patterns, speak clearly
3. **Campus wrong**: Say campus name clearly
4. **No response**: Check Claude API key
5. **404 errors**: Restart backend server

---

**Ready for demo! ðŸš€** 

Perfect! The backend is working correctly now. The response is:

```json
{
  "text": "I'd be happy to help you log stats! Which campus would you like to log stats for? You can say something like 'Salisbury campus' or 'South campus'.",
  "campus": null,
  "insights": ["Please select a campus first"],
  "suggestions": ["Try saying a campus name like 'Salisbury', 'South', 'Paradise', etc."]
}
```

This is the correct response. The issue you experienced ("love log stats for nun campus") might have been from an older version or a caching issue.

## ðŸ§ª **Try These Test Texts Again:**

### **1. Test No Campus (Should Work Now)**
```
Can I log stats?
```
**Expected**: Should say "I'd be happy to help you log stats! Which campus would you like to log stats for? You can say something like 'Salisbury campus' or 'South campus'."

### **2. Test Campus Detection**
```
Salisbury campus had 150 people, 8 new visitors, 3 salvations
```
**Expected**: Should detect Salisbury, extract stats, show transcript

### **3. Test Different Campus**
```
South campus had 200 people, 12 new visitors, 5 salvations
```
**Expected**: Should detect South, extract stats, update dropdown

**The backend is working correctly now!** The "nun campus" issue should be resolved. Try the tests again and let me know what happens! ðŸš€
